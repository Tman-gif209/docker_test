<h3>Short Bio:</h3>
<p>My name is Mohale but i prefer to be called Thabo. I recently matriculated from High school. I have experience in Technical crew, I was working back stage, and was involved in alot of shows at school and then went on tour to Durban for it. I am very passionate about rugby, thats why i have a participation award for it, unfortunately didnt go provincial but i am still willing to give it a go.
    I enjoy working out and staying healthy. What motivates me in life is My mom and dad, they did not come from an easy life, they made a lot of sacrifices for me and I wish to pay them back for everything they have done for me. What I would like most to do is be a professional rugby player, have multiple streams of income and just be successful and to help others struggling and get them closer to God.
